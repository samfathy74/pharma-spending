`` Pharmaceutical expenditure for countries from 1985-2016 ``

> Pharmaceutical expenditure covers spending on prescription medicines and self-medication (often referred to as OTC products). Some countries cannot report a breakdown, and their data may include medical non-durables (such as first aid kits and hypodermic syringes); this typically leads to an overestimation by 5-10%. Retail pharmaceuticals are those provided outside hospital care, dispensed by a retail pharmacy or bought from a supermarket, and the prices should include wholesale and retail margins and value added tax. Comparability issues exist regarding the administration and dispensing of pharmaceuticals for hospital outpatients. In some countries, the costs are included under curative care; in others, under pharmaceuticals.

>Analysing retail pharmaceutical spending only gives a partial picture of the cost of pharmaceuticals in the health system. Spending on medicines in the hospital sector can be significant â€“ typically accounting for 20% on top of retail spending. Over the last decade, hospital pharmaceutical spending has grown substantially, partly due to the advent of new high-cost treatments, particularly in oncology and immunology.
